          I am not proud of some of the things I have done
          To get to where I am
          I am not perfect, not even close
          I am perfectly flawed and human
          I have done alot of mistakes in the past
          Some of which I did knowingly 
          While I knew not of the others
          And I am not proud of that 

          I seek forgiveness to those that I've wronged 
          At the time I did what I thought best
          I seek forgiveness to the ones that I've hurt
          I am really sorry and I hope we live past this
          I beseech all those that I have had a hand on their suffering
          I wish I could turn back time and do the right thing

          I also have ungodly habits
          That I am trying to let go of
          It's not easy, it never is
          Because I keep stumbling everyday
          But I am not giving up.

          I want to rewrite the stars
          Then do things right this time
          I want to become better, a better me
